# Sales-Data-Analysis--Excel-From-Coursera
I took the 'Introduction to Data Analysis using Microsoft Excel' from Coursera which is free and instead of guidance i made it a question and then I solved it, and with the video of Coursera I could check myself.
1. check which sales had 20 and more chairs, if they have more or equal to 20 they need to get discount.
**solution-** adding discount column to the table and entering IF equation- if less then 20 receive N, opposite receive Y.
2. we want to calculate the final price  for the sale, applying the discount only to the sales that had 20 or more chairs.
**solution-** adding column name Final Price and with the IF equation, a 5 percent discount is applied to the relevant sales.
3.we want to add column that include the company name in addition to the client ID.
**solution-** using the VLOOKUP equation with the Customer Info worksheet.
4. adding a new column with the names of the client representative.
**solution-** using the VLOOKUP equation with the Customer Info worksheet.
5. imagine your boss asks you to calculate how much each sales representative made in sales throughout the first six months of the year.
**solution-** pivot table where in the Values I put the Final Price, in Rows I put the Months and in Columns I put the Sales Rep.
6. calculate using the pivot table how many chairs of each model were sold each month.
**solution-** pivot table where in the Values I put the Number, in Rows I put the Months and in Columns I put the Model.
